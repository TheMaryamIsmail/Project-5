                    <p> Flowers carry deep symbolism across cultures and history. They are nature's artwork, evoking emotions and conveying messages without words. Philosophically, flowers represent the fleeting beauty and impermanence of life. Each type of flower tells its own story: the rose speaks of love, the lily of purity, and the daisy of innocence. The act of giving or receiving flowers symbolizes respect, remembrance, and connection. In essence, flowers are a universal language, bridging human emotions and natural beauty.
